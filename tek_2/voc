hello my name is oliver and today i will present you an inovation.
Today a lot of people love to eat egg. But to cook it you need a lot of patience and you need a pan an other things to cook it.
There is some peril because when you cook it in a pan with the hot water and it s time to pick up it you can burn your finger.

So we have an idea. We see a lot lof people who explose eggs in there microwaves on the web. So we think to make some thing that allow you to cook your egg in a micro wave
and so it prevent you from burning you fingers and it save you a lot time.
So this where our first product whitsch work with a microwave but today i introduce you the eggcelent V2 which is a small microwave for cooking eggs.

If i m here today it s because we don' t have a lot of money and we need an extra of 200 000 for the industry because we have invest in an internnet compony of
export and so they create, and send our products. We have make a website to sell our products.

Thanks for your attention.
